[5] Intro: JUSTACHATAPP! is a chat app made using React.js, a JavaScript frontend library to build intuitive UI. The core of this app is the chat feature itself
which allows you to chat with people in your team. You may login using the credentials provided by the admin (see point 4 for credentials or get to home page right away
and see the demo credentials). In this app, you can also send pictures, which is incredibly handy and cool! All of this is possible thanks to Chat Engine's API, which 
takes care of the interaction between the users. To test the app from 2 different account, open your browser in normal mode and in incognito mode, and then login using
different credentials. Then you'll be able to communicate with each other provided that these 2 accounts are in the same group (all users from the provided credentials
are in the same group, which is called "Amazing People"). This project also makes use of Axios to make HTTP requests to Chat Engine's API. Also, it makes use of Ant Design
for the icons. JUSTACHATAPP! is implemented using new React.js' features such as React Hooks and is in accordance to ECMAScript 6+ specifications such as by using template
literals, object destructuring, spread operator, et cetera. See the live version to see how amazing this app it for yourself : https://justachatapp.netlify.app/
